We know from experience that it's unruly to have all of our functions in the same file and scope.  In this lesson we're going to cover how to group functions and define a struct, which is a specialized map, in order to organize our code more efficiently.

## Modules

Modules are the best way to organize functions into a namespace.  In addition to grouping functions, they allow us to define named and private functions which we covered in the previous lesson.

Let's look at a basic example:

``` elixir
defmodule Example do
  def greeting(name) do
    "Hello #{name}."
  end
end

iex> Example.greeting "Sean"
"Hello Sean."
```

It's possible to nest modules in Elixir, allowing you to further namespace your functionality:

```elixir
defmodule Example.Greetings do
  def morning(name) do
    "Good morning #{name}."
  end

  def evening(name) do
    "Good night #{name}."
  end
end

iex> Example.Greetings.morning "Sean"
"Good morning Sean."
```

### Module attributes

Module attributes are most commonly used as constants in Elixir.  Let's take a look at a simple example:

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  @greeting "Hello"

  def greeting(name) do
    "#{@greeting} #{name}."
  end
end
```

It is important to note there are reserved attributes in Elixir.  The three most common are:

+ `moduledoc` — Documents the current module.
+ `doc` — Documentation for functions and macros.
+ `behaviour` — Use an OTP or user-defined behaviour.

## Structs

Structs are special maps with a defined set of keys and default values.  It must be defined within a module, which it takes its name from.  It is common for a struct to be the only thing defined within a module.

To define a struct we use `defstruct` along with a keyword list of fields and default values:

```elixir
defmodule Example.User do
  defstruct name: "Sean", roles: []
end
```

Let's create some structs:

```elixir
iex> %Example.User{}
%Example.User{name: "Sean", roles: []}

iex> %Example.User{name: "Steve"}
%Example.User{name: "Steve", roles: []}

iex> %Example.User{name: "Steve", roles: [:admin, :owner]}
%Example.User{name: "Steve", roles: [:admin, :owner]}
```

We can update our struct just like we would a map:

```elixir
iex> steve = %Example.User{name: "Steve", roles: [:admin, :owner]}
%Example.User{name: "Steve", roles: [:admin, :owner]}
iex> sean = %{steve | name: "Sean"}
%Example.User{name: "Sean", password: nil, roles: [:admin, :owner]}
```

Most importantly, you can match structs against maps:

```elixir
iex> %{name: "Sean"} = sean
%Example.User{name: "Sean", roles: [:admin, :owner]}
```

## Composition

Now that we know how to create modules and structs let's learn how to include existing functionality in them through composition.  Elixir provides us with a variety of different ways to interact with other modules, so let's look at what we have available to us.

### `alias`

Allows us to alias module names, used quite frequently in Elixir code:  

```elixir
defmodule Sayings.Greetings do
  def basic(name), do: "Hi, #{name}"
end

defmodule Example do
  alias Sayings.Greetings
  
  def greeting(name), do: Greetings.basic(name)
end

# Without alias

defmodule Example do
  def greeting(name), do: Saying.Greetings.basic(name)
end
```

If there's a conflict with two aliases or you wish to alias to a different name entirely, we can use the `:as` option:

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  alias Sayings.Greetings, as: Hi
  
  def print_message(name), do: Hi.basic(name)
end
```

It's possible to alias multiple modules at once:

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  alias Sayings.{Greetings, Farewells}
end
```

### `import`

If we want to import functions and macros rather than aliasing the module we can use `import/`:

```elixir
iex> last([1, 2, 3])
** (CompileError) iex:9: undefined function last/1
iex> import List
nil
iex> last([1, 2, 3])
3
```

#### Filtering

By default all functions and macros are imported, but we can filter them using the `:only` and `:except` options.

To import specific functions and macros, we need to provide the name/arity pairs to `:only` and `:except`.  Let's start by importing only the `last/1` function:

```elixir
iex> import List, only: [last: 1]
iex> first([1, 2, 3])
** (CompileError) iex:13: undefined function first/1
iex> last([1, 2, 3])
3
```

If we import everything except `last/1` and try the same functions as before:

```elixir
iex> import List, except: [last: 1]
nil
iex> first([1, 2, 3])
1
iex> last([1, 2, 3])
** (CompileError) iex:3: undefined function last/1
```

In addition to the name/arity pairs there are two special atoms, `:functions` and `:macros`, which import only functions and macros respectively:

```elixir
import List, only: :functions
import List, only: :macros
```

### `require`

Although used less frequently, `require/2` is nonetheless important.  Requiring a module ensures that it is compiled and loaded.  This is most useful when we need to access a module's macros:

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  require SuperMacros

  SuperMacros.do_stuff
end
```

If we attempt to call a macro that is not yet loaded Elixir will raise an error.

### `use`

Uses the module in the current context.  This is particularly useful when a module needs to perform some setup.  By calling `use` we invoke the `__using__` hook within the module, providing the module an opportunity to modify our existing context:

```elixir
defmodule MyModule do
  defmacro __using__(opts) do
    quote do
      import MyModule.Foo
      import MyModule.Bar
      import MyModule.Baz

      alias MyModule.Repo
    end
  end
end
```
